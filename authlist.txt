# Permissions list for use by the IcyAuthControls Udon scripts

# Line format is as follows:
# display name : permissions level

# Permissions level ranges from 0 to 255.  Items and events can be locked behind different permissions levels, with only users with that permissions level or greater being able to use them.
# The world host can have their permissions level hard-coded by the world if the author chooses to do so, which will override anything in this file.


# Test Users (I gotta be able to use the stuff to demonstrate/test it, feel free to adjust this once you feel this has been done to an acceptable degree.)
